- How to reduce redundant information across referenced resources?
    - For example, a DiagnosticReport may contain more than one Observations. Since different Observations belong to the same report, many of the attributes except for the actual value or interpretation will be different. Hence there can be lots of redundant information. Also such information may be also redundant at another resource (e.g. subject is repeated in DiagnosticReport)
